# React.js Pokedex

A couple of years ago I had to build a Pokedex in Vue.js as a take-home assignment for a job interview. Because I've been hands-off coding since then and feeling my skills getting a little rusty I figured I'd rebuild the thing in React for a fun ("fun") weekend project.

Original Vue version is here: https://github.com/humantorch/pokemans-vue
